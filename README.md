# Phuniks

A 2D physics simulator sandbox, inspired by Phun (now [Algodoo](http://www.algodoo.com/)), that runs natively on Linux.

It uses [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) for graphics, and [Pymunk](https://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/) for the physics, which in turn uses [Chipmunk2D](https://chipmunk-physics.net/). It also gets a little help with polygons from [pyclipper](https://pypi.org/project/pyclipper/) / [Clipper2](http://www.angusj.com/clipper2/Docs/Overview.htm)
